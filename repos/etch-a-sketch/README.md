I build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using html, css and javascript.

Version 1.0 (25.03.2024)
Completed the "The Odin Project" assignment of building a Etch-A-Sketch. It works but only has a basic design since making it look pretty wasn't part of the assignment.

The project includes:
- a function to create a grid where the size is based on the user input (input must be between 1 and 100),
- if the user clicks on 'create grid' again it clears the existing grid before creating a new one,
- a progressive darkening effect where each hover over a square darkens the square by 10%,
- the ability to reset the 'drawing',
- an eraser which let's the user erase each square on it's own,
