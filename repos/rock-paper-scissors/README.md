Version 1.0 (14.09.2023)

Completed the "The Odin Project" assignment of building a rock paper scissors game. The game works in the terminal; building an UI wasn't part of the assignment. Might build an UI later, though.

Includes the following:
- functions to get the computer's choice and the player input,
- a function to validate the player input (input must be "rock", "paper" or "scissors"),
- a function to compare the two selected choices to determine who wins the round,
- game ends after 5 rounds.
